# 🚀 Mission to Predict: SpaceX Launch Success with Data Science

This is an end-to-end data science project aimed at predicting the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 first stage landings. The project involves collecting real-world launch data, cleaning and preprocessing it, exploring patterns, visualizing trends, and using machine learning to make predictions.

## 📁 Project Structure

Each part of the project is organized into a separate folder:

1. `1_data_collection_api` – Collected launch data using the SpaceX API.
2. `2_web_scraping` – Scraped payload and launch data from Wikipedia.
3. `3_data_wrangling` – Cleaned, transformed, and merged datasets.
4. `4_sql_analysis` – Performed exploratory data analysis using SQL.
5. `5_eda_visualization` – Used Pandas and Matplotlib to analyze trends.
6. `6_folium_map` – Created interactive maps of launch sites using Folium.
7. `7_dashboard` – Built an interactive dashboard with Plotly Dash.
8. `8_machine_learning` – Trained ML models to predict launch success.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Overview

We built classification models to predict the success of SpaceX launches based on features like:

- Payload mass
- Orbit type
- Launch site
- Booster version

We trained and evaluated Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest models, achieving up to **85% accuracy**.

## ▶️ How to Run the Dashboard

To launch the interactive dashboard locally on your system:

1. Navigate to the dashboard folder:
   ```bash
   cd 7_dashboard

2. Run the Dash app:
   ```bash
   python dashboard_app.py
   ```
3. Open your browser and go to:
   ```bash
   http://127.0.0.1:8050
   ```
